# tcpdump Component

```
type: tcpdump
exe:  phenix-scorch-component-tcpdump
```

It is assumed that the `tcpdump` executable is present in any VMs this component
will be executed against.

## Metadata Options

```
metadata:
  convertToJSON: <bool>
  vms:
  - hostname: <hostname of VM from topology to run tcpdump on>
    iface: <name of interface in VM to capture traffic from>
    options: <any additional options to pass to tcpdump>
    filter: <tcpdump filter expression>
  filebeat.inputs:
  - type: log
    enabled: true
    paths:
    - *.pcap.jsonl
    processors:
    - decode_json_fields:
        fields:
        - message
        target: scorch.tcpdump
    - drop_event:
        when:
          has_fields:
          - scorch.tcpdump.index._type
    - drop_fields:
        fields: ['message']
    - timestamp:
        field: scorch.tcpdump.timestamp
        layouts:
        - 'UNIX_MS'
```

No defaults exist for the `hostname` and `iface` options. They must be provided.
As of right now, the `iface` value must represent the name of the interface in
the VM. In the future, it will also support the name of the interface referenced
in the phenix topology file for the VM.

The `filter` and `options` VM options are optional.

The `tcpdump` component code automatically adds the `-i <iface>`, `-U`, and `-w
<path>` options to the command before being executed.

The `convertToJSON` option is important if Filebeat is going to be used to
process the results of the traffic capture to send to Elastic. By default it is
disabled since it can take a while to complete.

The `filebeat.inputs` section above can be blindly copied into user's own config
and used as-is, or users can choose to change target field names if the ones
used above aren't suitable.

> In the future, user components will have the ability to modify the
> `filebeat.inputs` section of component metadata directly so users don't have
> to know how the logs generated by components need to be processed.

## Example Configuration

```
components:
  - name: test-validator
    type: tcpdump
    metadata:
      convertToJSON: true
      vms:
      - hostname: sniffer
        iface: eth1
        options: -c 10
        filter: port 80
```
